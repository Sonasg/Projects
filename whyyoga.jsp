Yoga is a mind and body practice with historical origins in ancient Indian philosophy. Like other meditative movement practices used for health purposes, various styles of yoga typically combine physical postures, breathing techniques, and meditation or relaxation. This fact sheet provides basic information about yoga, summarizes scientific research on effectiveness and safety, and suggests sources for additional information.<br>
 <img  src="/ehealthcare/images/y1.jpg" style="height:100%; width:100%;"><br>Just as a plant recovers more quickly with the aid of healthy soil and frequent watering, so too, the human body often responds better to medical treatments when they are combined with alternative modalities, including yoga therapy.

There is increasing evidence that yoga therapy may enhance the results and alleviate the side effects of modern medical treatments. In yoga therapy, the body attains a relaxed state that allows it to gain the full benefit of prescription drugs or cope more effectively with treatments like chemotherapy or radiation for cancer.

Several studies indicate that the practice of yoga therapy may help reduce unwanted side-effects of conventional health treatments and improve overall well-being. In the case of prescription drugs, yoga therapy can actually make it possible to reduce dosage levels while maintaining effectiveness.

Yoga therapy can also aid in the healing of psychological disorders and trauma, when combined with traditional approaches such as counseling or psychotherapy. Yoga and other forms of therapy can work hand in hand to help a patient attain peace of mind. For example both yoga and meditation, an integral part of yoga, provide a way to center the mind and keep the awareness grounded in the body.

Due to its holistic nature, yoga therapy supports conventional treatments by providing the whole physiology with much needed rest and rejuvenation. By simultaneously strengthening and relaxing both the mind and body, yoga therapy can help patients cope with health concerns more effectively and return more quickly to thriving good health.</font>

<font size="5" style="text-align: justify;position: absolute;"><br>Aerobic exercises include various sports such as martial arts (which also combines anaerobic exercises), running, walking, cycling, swimming, skiing and of course indoor exercises.

The body needs a certain amount of energy to maintain some basic functions such as breathing, blood circulation and for the normal functioning of the different body organs. The energy needed to maintain these functions is known as BMR or basic metabolic rate. Any activity in addition to those basic functions requires additional energy, which is taken by the glycogen (carbohydrates) and deposits of fat in the blood, liver and muscles.<br>The benefits of aerobic exercise to protect the heart are very well known. But exercise is not only beneficial for the heart and muscles. Other benefits of exercise includes:

<ul><li>1. Better cardiac function: The heart gets more blood per beat. That means that the heart rate is reduced in times of relaxation and during the exercise.

<li>2. Weight loss: During exercise the body burns fat and as a result the total body fat is reduced.

<li>3. Improving mental health: Regular exercise releases the endorphins, the natural painkillers of the body, which among other things reduces stress, anxiety and depression.

<li>4. Helps the immune system: Numerous studies have shown that people who exercise regularly are less prone to mild viral infections such as colds or flu.

<li>5. Reducing diseases: The extra weight is an aggravating factor in the emergence of: heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes and certain types of cancer. The risk to develop some of these diseases decreases as we lose weight. There is data showing that walking can reduce the risk of osteoporosis and the complications involved. While exercises such as swimming and water aerobics may help people with arthritis.

<li>6. Increases longevity: Research by the University of Harvard, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1986, revealed that for the first time there was a scientific link between exercise and longevity. Since then, other research confirms this initial assessment.

<li>7. Increases body resistance: Maybe during or immediately after exercise you feel tired, but in the long-term exercise increases the strength and the sense of well-being keeping fatigue away.

<li>8. Improves muscle health: Exercise encourages the development of microscopic blood vessels that provide sufficient quantities of oxygen in the muscles and keep away from the muscles metabolic wastes such as lactic acid. This process can reduce the discomfort felt by those suffering from chronic muscle pain and back pain.

<li>9. Increases the maximum consumption of oxygen by the body

<li>10. Improves cardiovascular and cardiovascular function

<li>11. Increasing the supply of blood to muscles and the ability to make better use of oxygen

<li>12. Lowers heart rate and blood pressure

<li>13. Lowers the accumulation of lactic acid which causes pain and muscle burning

<li>14. Lowest systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients suffering from hypertension (high pressure)

<li>15. Increasing levels of good HDL cholesterol in the blood

<li>16. Reduces high blood triglycerides

<li>17. Improvement of glucose metabolism reduces insulin resistance and therefore lowers the risk of diabetes or regulates better the disease if it has already occurred.

<li>18. Reduces psychological stress, improves mood with more vitality, reduces risk of depression or anxiety

<li>19. Greater resistance to fatigue

<li>20. Helps us to sleep better</li></ul></font>

<h2 style="color: black; font-family: Palatino Linotype;text-align: center;">Various Diseases And Problems Cured By Yoga And Aerobics  
</h2> <strong><ul><li><h3 style="font-size: x-large;text-decoration: underline;text-align: inherit;">Cures By Yoga</h3>
</strong></li></ul></h3> <font size="5" style="text-align: justify;position: absolute;">Recent studies in people with chronic low-back pain suggest that a carefully adapted set of yoga poses may help reduce pain and improve function (the ability to walk and move). Studies also suggest that practicing yoga (as well as other forms of regular exercise) might have other health benefits such as reducing heart rate and blood pressure, and may also help relieve anxiety and depression. Other research suggests yoga is not helpful for asthma, and studies looking at yoga and arthritis have had mixed results.<br><li>Yoga for Flexibility

Yoga poses work by stretching your muscles. They can help you move better and feel less stiff or tired.

At any level of yoga, you'll probably start to notice benefits soon. In one study, people improved their flexibility by up to 35% after only 8 weeks of yoga.</li>Better Posture From Yoga

When you're stronger and more flexible, your posture improves.

Most standing and sitting poses develop core strength, since you need your core muscles to support and maintain each pose.

With a stronger core, you're more likely to sit and stand "tall."

Yoga also helps your body awareness. That helps you notice more quickly if you're slouching or slumping, so you can adjust your posture.<li><li>Good for Your Heart

Yoga has long been known to lower blood pressure and slow the heart rate. A slower heart rate can benefit people with high blood pressure or heart disease, and people who've had a stroke.</li><li>Cancer. Practice of Hatha Yoga may improve quality-of-life measures in cancer patients. It is unclear what aspect(s) may be beneficial or what populations should be targeted.[29] Hatha Yoga practice as part of cancer treatment has also shown improvement in biomarkers such as TNF-alpha, Interleukin 6 and IL-1beta. Stronger effects on biomarkers as well as quality-of-life measures is associated with more frequent Hatha Yoga practice. Hatha Yoga has no effect on the underlying disease.</li><li>Eases Migraines:Research shows that migraine sufferers have fewer and less painful migraines after three months of yoga practice. The cause of migraines isn't fully understood, but Bleier says it could be a combination of mental stressors and physical misalignment that create migraines and other issues. Hunching over a computer or cell phone with your shoulders up and head forward causes overlifting of your trapezius and tightening of the neck. This pulls the head forward and creates muscle imbalances that can contribute to headaches and migraines.</li></font></div>

<h2 style="color: black;font-family: Palatino Linotype;text-align: center;">Some Yoga Aasans
</h2><strong><ul><h3 style="font-size: x-large;text-decoration: underline;text-align: inherit;"> Bridge Pose (Setu Bandha Sarvangasana)</h3>
</strong></ul></h3> <font size="5" style="text-align: justify;position: absolute;">Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet hip-distance apart on the floor. With your hands resting on the floor, begin to press down into your legs and draw your hips toward the sky. The key, Bleier says, is to keep your shoulders in line with the base of your neck, moving the back of the shoulders together so the shoulder blades are close. Lift your chest towards your chin and your chin away from your chest, so the upper trapezius muscles flow away from the head.
<strong><ul><h3 style="font-size: x-large;text-decoration: underline;text-align: inherit;">Bound Angle Pose (Baddha Konasana)</strong></ul></h3><br>Sit with your feet together and your knees bent and reaching toward the floor. Slowly fold over your feet while trying to bring your knees closer to the ground while moving the groin back and engaging the pelvic floor muscles. 
<strong><ul><h3 style="font-size: x-large;text-decoration: underline;text-align: inherit;"> Corpse Pose (Savasana) with Diaphragmatic Breathing</h3></ul></strong>
Corpse Pose (Savasana) with Diaphragmatic Breathing
Savasana is the final pose in a yoga class and is meant to restore the body. Lay on your back with your legs slightly apart and your arms extended at your side and your hands on your belly. Inhale and exhale through your nose, follow the breath and feel the belly rise and fall under your hands. The breath, muscles, and mind should be completely relaxed.
 <strong><ul><h3 style="font-size: x-large;text-decoration: underline;text-align: inherit;">Meditation</h3></ul></strong>Sit or lay in any comfortable position and bring attention to the natural breath moving in and out through your nose. Next, bring attention to the triangular area around the tip of your nose and upper lip, paying attention to your breath hitting this space as you exhale, the temperature of your breath, and which nostril you're breathing through. Try this for two minutes, working up to five or more.
